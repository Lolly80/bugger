# bugger

WIP of porting `node-inspector` and `nodebug` to a more up-to-date version of developer tools,
throwing in support for source maps, network monitoring and maybe more.

## Recreate
The following command was used to create the public folder:
```
svn co http://svn.webkit.org/repository/webkit/trunk/Source/WebCore/inspector/front-end/ public/
```
